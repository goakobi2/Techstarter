            <li>Message indicating whether the retrieval was successful</li>
            <li>Amount of data transferred</li>
            <li>Information about the browser type and version used</li>
            <li>Operating system</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The temporary storage of data is necessary for the duration of a website visit to enable the delivery of the website. Further storage in log files is done to ensure the functionality of the website and the security of the information technology systems. Our legitimate interest in data processing lies in these purposes.</p>

        <h4>b. On What Legal Basis is This Data Processed?</h4>
        <p>The data is processed based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.</p>

        <h4>c. [If applicable] Are there other recipients of the personal data besides the controller?</h4>
        <p>The website is hosted by [Name, Address, Email of the host]. The host receives the above-mentioned data as a processor.</p>

        <h4>d. How Long is the Data Stored?</h4>
        <p>The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection. In the case of providing the website, this is the case when the respective session is ended. The log files are kept for a maximum of 24 hours and are accessible only to administrators. After that, they are only available indirectly through the reconstruction of backup tapes and will be permanently deleted after a maximum of four weeks.</p>

        <h3>3. Rights of the Data Subjects</h3>
        <h4>a. Right to Information</h4>
        <p>You can request information under Art. 15 GDPR about your personal data that we process.</p>

        <h4>b. Right to Object:</h4>
        <p>You have the right to object for special reasons (see under Section II).</p>

        <h4>c. Right to Rectification</h4>
        <p>If the information concerning you is not (any longer) accurate, you can request rectification under Art. 16 GDPR. If your data is incomplete, you can request completion.</p>

        <h4>d. Right to Deletion</h4>
        <p>You can request the deletion of your personal data under Art. 17 GDPR.</p>

        <h4>e. Right to Restriction of Processing</h4>
        <p>You have the right to request a restriction of the processing of your personal data under Art. 18 GDPR.</p>

        <h4>f. Right to Complain</h4>
        <p>If you believe that the processing of your personal data violates data protection law, you have the right to complain to a data protection authority of your choice under Art. 77 (1) GDPR. This includes the data protection authority responsible for the controller: State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information North Rhine-Westphalia, <a href="https://www.ldi.nrw.de/kontakt/ihre-beschwerde" target="_blank">https://www.ldi.nrw.de/kontakt/ihre-beschwerde</a>.</p>

        <h4>g. Right to Data Portability</h4>
        <p>If the conditions of Art. 20 (1) GDPR are met, you have the right to have data that we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to third parties. The collection of data for providing the website and the storage of log files are essential for the operation of the website. They are therefore not based on consent under Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR or on a contract under Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR, but are justified under Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The conditions of Art. 20 (1) GDPR are therefore not fulfilled in this respect.</p>

        <h2>II. Right to Object According to Art. 21 (1) GDPR</h2>
        <p>You have the right to object at any time, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to the processing of your personal data that is carried out based on Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The controller will no longer process the personal data unless he can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override the interests, rights, and freedoms of the data subject, or the processing serves the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. The collection of data for providing the website and the storage of log files are essential for the operation of the website.</p>
