    <p>Earl Simmons was born in 1970 in Mount Vernon, New York, and grew up in nearby Yonkers in Westchester County. He was raised in a very religious and Christian household under poor conditions. His mother was a Jehovah's Witness. In his youth, he was incarcerated in a juvenile detention center for robbery, among other offenses. He attended the same school as Jay-Z, Busta Rhymes, and Biggie Smalls. His stage name "DMX" stands for Dark Man X, although he initially called himself "Divine Master of the Unknown" in his debut single. He gained national recognition by winning The Source magazine's Unsigned Hype Award and with his debut single "Born Loser," although the single was not a commercial success. He released several albums and singles that were more successful, and in 1998, he joined the group Ruff Ryders.</p>
    
    <p>His debut album "It's Dark and Hell Is Hot" was released in 1998 and reached number one on the Billboard charts. Later, the albums "Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood" (1998), "... And Then There Was X" (1999), "The Great Depression" (2001), and his fifth album "Grand Champ" (2003) were released, during which he announced his retirement from music. However, in July 2005, he announced a new album titled "Year of the Dog... Again," which was released in August 2006. All albums except the last one debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, while "Year of the Dog... Again" debuted at number two. In 2006, he had his own show "Soul of a Man" on the American television network Black Entertainment Television, where he talked about his Christian life. In 2003, he wrote his autobiography "E.A.R.L.: The Autobiography of DMX."</p>
    
    <p>His albums "Walk With Me Now" and "You'll Fly With Me Later," planned for late 2008, were postponed to summer 2009 after he was sentenced to 90 days in prison in January 2009 in Phoenix for animal abuse, drug offenses, and theft. In 2011, he had to serve time again for various offenses (including violating probation and assault). He was released in July 2011 after seven months. He then announced a new studio album. "Undisputed" was supposed to be released in June 2012, featuring guest appearances from Busta Rhymes, Tyrese, and Jennifer Hudson, but was postponed to September 2012. The announced guest features were not included on the album. The first single from the album, "I Don't Dance," was released several months before the album's release.</p>
    
    <p>On April 2, 2021, DMX was hospitalized after a heart attack caused by an overdose in White Plains, New York. He died on April 9, 2021, at the age of 50. Following Simmons' death, four of his songs charted in the top 10 of the iTunes song charts on the same day. In late May 2021, his eighth studio album "Exodus" was released posthumously.</p>
